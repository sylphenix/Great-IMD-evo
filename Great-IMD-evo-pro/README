== Great Indigo Magic Desktop evolution ==

Great-IMD-evo is an sgi variation GTK2/3 theme. I love the classic IRIX style. But the strong embossed widgets now look a bit out of date. I developed this theme and tried to make it look more smooth and elegant, but to keep the essence of the original sgi grey scheme.

It is light and minimal. There are no transitions or effects, and also no need for any extra theme engine. Just keep everything clear and efficient.

It has been tested on Debian 10 (buster) with xfce4, openbox, fvwm, gnome, and a good amount of GTK2 and GTK3 applications. 

The pro version: With this version, colors are dimmed down. It's better for professional use.
