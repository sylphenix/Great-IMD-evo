== Great Indigo Magic Desktop evolution ==

Great-IMD-evo is a Gtk 2 & 3 theme with some colors and widgets inspired by the sgi IRIX 4Dwm. The classic IRIX style now looks a bit out of date. I developed this theme and try to make it look more smooth and elegant, but to keep the essence of the original sgi grey scheme.

It has been tested on Debian(buster) with xfce4, openbox, fvwm, a good amount of Gtk2 and Gtk3 applications. It is not tested at all with unity.

==Version==

Current version is 0.9, released in Sep 2020.


==Installation==

To install the theme, unzip the archive and copy the theme in your theme directory. There is no need for any extra //engine//.
